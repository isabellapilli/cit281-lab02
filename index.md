## LAB 2

```markdown
Lab Goals and Outcomes:

Use CLI commands for directory and file manipulation
Use CLI commands for git commands

1. Setup git user credentials
2. New git repository
3. Initial JavaScript file
4. Add file to git
5. Ignoring files
6. Using diff to see changes
7. Using wildcards
8. Cloning cloud repos locally
9. Branch
10. Repo files

```

### Technologies Used:
- Chrome
- VS Code
- Git
- Terminal

### What I Learned:
In this lab I was introduced to git software. I created a new JavaScript Node.js file and used git to manage the file. Git repos fall into three different categories: untracked, tracked, and ignored and I learned how to manage them with different git commands such as git add, git commit, git diff, git status, git clone, git branch, and even more.
